In addition to the options listed publicly, the following options exist for
internal use only. __Setting them yourself will either be terribly bad or just
be ignored by BM__. Do __not__ set these.

# `post_file_name`

The original file name for the post we are working on and these options belong
to. This was a lifesaver when we were mucking around in a sea of temporary
files, which doesn't really describe BM after the v3.0.0 release.
It will continue getting set into the v3.0.0 series and for the
foreseeable future, though it may not actually get used.
