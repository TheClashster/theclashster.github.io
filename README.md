- Personal website, mainly to put everything together in one place.

- Quite challenging, as I don't have much prior experience.
It pays off hopefully.
- I'm writing everything myself to learn firsthand. This is more about what I know than what I can make using code off the internet.

- Has a pretty nice **dark mode** if you're into that. I love it personally.

WIP Project, hopefully will be done by college apps.

Let me know what you think.
