- Personal website, mainly to put everything together in one place.

- Quite challenging, as I don't have much prior experience.
It pays off hopefully.
- I'm writing everything myself to learn firsthand. This is more about what I know than what I can make using code off the internet.

- Has a pretty nice **dark mode** if you're into that. I love it personally.

### web trickery
The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance is the landing graphic, which is an image but also has 
separate links and supports the dark mode as well.

That is made possible by a clever hack of sorts, the image is nothing but a SVG, 
and SVGs are nothing but XMLs, and XMLs support styling ðŸ˜›

Let me know what you think.
